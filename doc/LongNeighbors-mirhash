--- Testing mirhash "mirhash" GOOD

[[[ 'LongNeighbors' Tests ]]]

Looking for 2-bit collisions in the last 2400 bits.
Looking for 4-bit collisions in the last 2048 bits.
Looking for 6-bit collisions in the last 160 bits.
Trying bases of length 10 to 300, 5 of each length.

Among 175 tested bases, we expected 2.18412e-06 bads. Actually there were 2.
The most striking collision has surprise score 1.07123e+08 and lengths 25 and 24 bytes:
000: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF E7 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
                                                    ^E6^
018: 00
    ^eof
The hashes are length 8 bytes:
000: 0B 0C 0F 41 AF 1C 29 6B
*********FAIL*********


Input vcode 0x00000001, Output vcode 0x00000001, Result vcode 0x00000001
Verification value is 0x00000001 - Testing took 17.939765 seconds
