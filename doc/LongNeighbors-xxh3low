--- Testing xxh3low "xxHash v3, 64-bit, low 32-bits part" GOOD

[[[ 'LongNeighbors' Tests ]]]

Looking for 2-bit collisions in the last 2400 bits.
Looking for 4-bit collisions in the last 256 bits.
Looking for 6-bit collisions in the last 40 bits.
Trying bases of length 10 to 300, 5 of each length.

Among 1455 tested bases, we expected 323.171 bads. Actually there were 330.
The most striking collision has surprise score 130.332 and lengths 232 and 224 bytes:
