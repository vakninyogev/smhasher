[[[ LongNeighbors Tests ]]]

Looking for 2-bit collisions in the last 2400 bits.
Looking for 4-bit collisions in the last 256 bits.
Looking for 6-bit collisions in the last 40 bits.
Trying bases of length 10 to 300, 5 of each length.

Among 1455 tested bases, we expected 323.171 bads. Actually there were 27.
The most striking collision has surprise score 28.1252 and lengths 96 and 95 bytes:
000: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
018: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
    ^DF^
030: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
048: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FB DF 00
                                                                   ^FF^FF^eof
The hashes are length 4 bytes:
