--- Testing seahash32low "seahash - lower 32bit" GOOD

[[[ 'LongNeighbors' Tests ]]]

Looking for 2-bit collisions in the last 2400 bits.
Looking for 4-bit collisions in the last 256 bits.
Looking for 6-bit collisions in the last 40 bits.
Trying bases of length 10 to 300, 5 of each length.

Among 1455 tested bases, we expected 323.171 bads. Actually there were 318.
The most striking collision has surprise score 5603.95 and length 90 bytes:
000: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

       ^00^                                         ^14^
The hashes are length 4 bytes:
000: B2 E2 57 63


Input vcode 0x00000001, Output vcode 0x00000001, Result vcode 0x00000001
Verification value is 0x00000001 - Testing took 5.521209 seconds
